 Fire Alarm Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Classification Project
This project focuses on predicting fire alarm events using real-time sensor data such as temperature, humidity, and smoke levels. 
The objective is to build a robust classification model that can proactively detect potential fire situations and trigger timely alerts.
 I performed data cleaning, EDA, and implemented various classification algorithms, with Random Forest achieving the best results â€” boasting
 95%+ accuracy and a log loss of just 0.002. The model was further deployed as an interactive web app using Streamlit, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces,
 allowing users to input live sensor values and get instant fire risk predictions.
